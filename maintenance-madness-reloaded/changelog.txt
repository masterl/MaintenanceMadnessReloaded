Version: 0.9.7
Date: 2019-09-11
  Features:
    - Repair mechanic updated: To repair a broken machine, only repair packs are needed. After providing them, the machine will request additional repair materials, which will in turn significantly reduce repair time.
    - Added a gui to select specific item usage rules for your machines
    - Added maximum operation age: Machines that reach this age (currently 150% of expected operation age) will shut down to prevent critical failures
  Balancing:
    - Repair mechanic update: From now on only repair are needed to repair broken machines. This will make basic maintenance of bases much less of a hassle.

    - Fixed missing replacement requests after repair of old solar panels and accumulators
    - Fixed wrong icon size for some scrap items of mod machines
