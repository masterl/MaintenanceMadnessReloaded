[mod-setting-description]
mm-mod-active=Enable this setting, if you want to use this mod for your game. Overrides all other settings.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-maintenance-cost=Amounts of materials required for the maintenance and repair of machinery. The higher this cost, the harder it will be to keep large bases in check.\n\nPossible values:\nReduced: 50%\nNormal: 100%\nExpensive: 150%\nGrueling: 250%
mm-show-flying-text=If this option is set to active, a flying text is shown for a short moment every time a machine changes its state (e.g. "Malfunction" or "repaired").
mm-show-maintenance-in-progress-sign-for-solar=If this option is set to active, the orange "repair in progress" sign will also be displayed on solar panels and accumulators. This option is disabled by default to save on FPS.\nChanging this setting will only take effect slowly.
mm-expected-life-time=The expected life time of a machine in hours.\n\nGreater values reduce the cost of machine replacements but somewhat increase the cost of regular repairs.
mm-mean-time-between-maintenance-events=Mean time between two maintenance events in minutes.\n\nThe shorter this time, the more frequently machines have to be serviced or repaired. If you set this value to a very low value, the game may slow down if your factory is very large.
mm-mean-time-to-maintain=Mean time needed to service a machine.\n\nAfter this time, the machine checks if the the requested maintenance materials have been delivered. The shorter this time, the more difficult it is for robots to deliver the materials in time. 
mm-mean-time-to-repair=Mean time needed to repair a broken down machine.\n\nThis time increases proportionally to the age of the machine. The affected machine is completely inactive during this time. The greater this value, the more severe is the impact of broken down machines on the overal throughput of your factory.
mm-include-accumulators=If this option is enabled, accumulators require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-solar-panels=If this option is enabled, solar panels require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-reactors=If this option is enabled, reactors require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-boiler-and-generators=If this option is enabled, boilers and generators require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-miners=If this option is enabled, resource miner require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-roboports=If this option is enabled, roboports require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-beacons=If this option is enabled, beacons require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-include-labs=If this option is enabled, labs require regular servicing and repair.\n\nWARNING: This setting should only be changed in a running game. 
mm-solar-factor=This multiplier determines how long a maintenance cycle for solar panels or accumulators lasts.\nAging and material requirements are also multiplied. This is mostly to reduce UPS impact on large bases with significant amounts of solar panels and accumulators. 
mm-replacement-age=The default age in percent of the expected life time, from which machines start to request replacement.\n\nThe lower this value, the shorter is the mean life cycle of the machines in your factory, which increases the overall cost. Setting this to a higher value will save on materials but will also reduce your factory's throughput, as older machines tend to break down more often.
mm-wear-reduction-if-idle=Probability in percent that a machine will not age if it hasn't finished any goods in the last maintenance interval.\n\nThis applies to assembling machines, furnaces, refineries, mining drills, labs, reactors, boilers and generators
mm-missed-maintenance-malus=This value determines the maximum percentage by which a machine ages additionally if none of the requested maintenance materials have been delivered. This effect is reduced if the requirement is partially met.\n\nHigher values increase the importance of regular maintenance. A value of 0 renders maintenance irrelevant.
mm-enable-low-tech-bonus=[font=default-bold]If enabled, the probability for maintenance and repair events is greatly reduced at game start (only 20%).[/font]\n\nThe bonus is diminished whenever a faction researches technologies that are indirect or direct prerequisites of the defined target technology ("Rocket silo" by default). Technologies are weighted according to their research costs. If the target technology is researched, the bonus expires.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=128, 206, 240]This setting is recommended for games with a long build-up phase[/color][/font]
mm-low-tech-bonus-target-tech=Determines the target technology if "Less maintenance at game start" is enabled.\n\nThe name of the technology must represent a valid prototype name. If no valid name is given, the setting is reset to "rocket-silo". (Tip: press __CONTROL__debug-toggle-debug-settings__, enable "show-debug-info-in-tooltips" and hover your mouse over a technology to see its internal name). 
mm-enable-low-tech-update-notification=Determines if a console message should be displayed after finishing a research that is a prerequisite of the target technology.
